# Two counter

Here we will be making a modified count application.

Instead of incrementing and decrementing by one, we will let user decide by what number to change
count.

Lets first define the countby.
Make a div with id="countby", inside it
make two buttons with id="incr-countby" and id="decr-countby" which as the name suggests increment and decrement countby value
which we will use in counter, this value by default only changes by one.
Also inside the same #countby div make another div with id="countby-value" value which shows the current countby value.

Now for the main counter
Make a div with id="counter", inside it
make two buttons with id="incr-count" and id="decr-count" which as the name suggests increment and decrement counter by 
whatever is the current countby value.
Also make a div inside #counter div with id="count-value" which shows the current count value.

Note:- default value for counter and countby is 1.
